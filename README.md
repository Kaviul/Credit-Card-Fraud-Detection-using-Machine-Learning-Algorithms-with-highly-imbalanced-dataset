# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms-with-highly-imbalanced-dataset

In this project, I have conducted six machine learing algorithmsviz.- Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbour on a highly imbalanced dataset which I collected from https://www.kaggle.com/kartik2112/fraud-detection?select=fraudTrain.csv
To balance the dtaet I have divided the dataset into 10 balanced set; each set containing 6006 frauds and variable size of non-frauds (6006-50000) and simulated all the six algorithms with these 10 sets and compared the results.
First I manipulated and preprocessed the dataset.
